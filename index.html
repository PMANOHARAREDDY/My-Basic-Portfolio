            I am P Manohara Reddy, a dedicated student with a strong passion for Information Technology and Software Development. Currently, I am pursuing my education at the National Institute of Engineering (NIE) in Mysore, where I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program in Information Science and Engineering. I also have the privilege of studying at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Data Science and Applications.
With a solid foundation in programming and a keen interest in emerging technologies, I strive to bridge technical knowledge with essential soft skills. My goal is to craft innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in areas such as software development, data analysis, and system design.
Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in projects that enhance my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. I believe in continuous learning and am eager to contribute to collaborative environments that foster creativity and innovation.
In addition to my studies, I enjoy participating in tech-related events and hackathons, which allow me to connect with like-minded individuals and expand my knowledge. My commitment to excellence drives me to seek opportunities that will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
